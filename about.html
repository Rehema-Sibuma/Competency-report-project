    <h3>Biography</h3>
    </main>

<!--My first ever website, exciting things-->
    <h4><b>Who is Rehema?</b></h4>
    <p>My name is Rehema Sibuma and I am a US army veteran and R&D engineer at an aerospace company.<b>My educational background</b> is in Mechanical engineering, in which I attained from the University of Oklahoma. I love learning new things and in my free time I have been learning greetings and short sentences in other languages such as korean, spacish and french. As I love traveling and would like to pick on as many languages as possible to<i> be able to travel the world some day</i>. </p>
    <br>

    <h5><b>Why Coding?</b></h5>
    <p><i>The future innovation lies with software development</i>.</i> <i>Many industries have experienced high competition by apps, and may be wiped out if they dont innovate themselves, hotel businesses by airbnb, movie theaters by Netflix, Yellow taxi by uber/LYFT.</i> To me learning full stack development is a means to ensure I have the skills I need to persevere in this society we live. But I am learning this not only for job security but also I find it fun to code. For my Mechanical engineering degree I had to take two coding class in which I took C++ it was not easy and I tried to learn python on my own and that landed me an internship in which I used it to run a risk analysis. When I got to the internship however,I found out quickly that there was a lot I did not know and  needed to learn, but I thank stack overflow for getting me through those three months</p>
    <br>
    
     <h6><b>What I plan to do after this Immersive program?</b></h6>
    <p>First why did I decide to join this full stack immersive program, because it is shorter than a 4year college, but I can still use the credits if I wished to go back to university. I have alot to learn and need structure and displine and I believed that this program would provide that. Back to what I plan to do after: I have a lot of ideas that I would like to work on.<mark>Projects such as making my own apps, website and also see what job opportunities will be available for me.</mark> <ins> I am pretty excited to see what the future holds</ins> <sub>RS</sub> and looking forward to meeting the future me.<sup>RS</sup></p>
